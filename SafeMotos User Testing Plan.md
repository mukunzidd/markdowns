<h1 id="user-testing-plan">User Testing Plan!</h1>
<p>This plan shows and answers the most important questions about <strong>SafeMotos’ User Testing</strong>. The <em>Whats</em>, the <em>Whys</em>, the <em>Hows</em> and the <em>Whens</em>.</p>
<h1 id="testers--tests">1. Testers &amp; Tests</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>These are the FACTS</strong>
from studies and real world experiences, the numbers have shown that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You only need 5 users() to identify  85% of the usability problems</li>
<li>Doing <strong>3</strong> tests with <strong>5</strong> testers each is more efficient than a big one with <strong>15</strong> or <strong>20</strong> users. User less testers and give them more incentives so that they can be more helpful and retained if needs be.</li>
<li>Best testers should be from target audience/users</li>
<li>Testers should be random and represent that main categories/criteria of a user group</li>
</ul>
<p>In short the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/">internet</a> shows that Elaborate usability tests are a waste of resources. The best results come from testing no more than 5 users and running as many small tests as you can afford.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-users-at-safemotos">Types of users at SafeMotos</h2>
<ul>
<li>Customer app users</li>
<li>Driver app users</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="categories-of-tests">Categories of tests</h2>
<p>There are mainly two types of tests, which are UX (User Experience) and UA (User Acceptance), and improvised tests <em>(e.g: testing people who have never used the app or sth of sort ).</em></p>
<h3 id="user-experience">User Experience</h3>

<h3 id="improvised-tests">Improvised Tests</h3>
<p>These tests will be tests that will be planned and conducted for a specific reasons, they will be irregular.</p>
<h2 id="incentives">Incentives</h2>
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t have to be costly</li>
<li>But it has to be worth it</li>
<li>Consider the type of users and their life style. <em>e.g: a student may prefer 5000 rwf than five trips, but a corporate user would prefer the trips.</em></li>
<li>There should be options to choose from available for users.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="planning-the-interviewtasks">2. Planning the interview/tasks</h1>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Before inviting people to our testing, we’ll need to have a plan on what to ask.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The questions should be tasks, rather than asking for opinions. Users generally have no idea what they want, and you shouldn’t ask them to tell you.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Steve once said:</strong> "It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.”</p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We’ll want to give your participants concrete tasks, like :</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“sign up for an account” or “order a bike” or “take a FreeMotos trip” or “schedule a ride” and let them discover the interface on their own.</p>

<h1 id="carrying-out-the-interviewtasks">3. Carrying out the interview/tasks</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are a few thoughts about the actual testing session:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make sure to let the participants know that you will not be testing their abilities, but the product’s quality.</strong> Ask them to be critical about it and state their frustrations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A single session should be short,</strong> 30 minutes to an hour is plenty.</li>
<li>Write notes or record what’s being said in the interview. It may be very helpful to also write down a few bullet points after the interview is done.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t guide your participants.</strong> Have them explore the interface and interact with it as they see fit. Ask questions like “Why did you click on that button?” or “What did you think it would do?”</li>
<li><strong>Narrating the experience.</strong> Ask the participants to narrate their actions as they go.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="evaluating-the-results">4. Evaluating the results</h1>
<p>It should be very quick to notice which parts of our app/product don’t quite make it. Potential problems may be added onto the stack of things that should be fixed and further decisions taken based on results.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="patterns-that-commonly-arise-at-obvious-problems-are"><strong>Patterns that commonly arise at obvious problems are:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>User pauses when trying to complete a task,</li>
<li>User has to undo an action,</li>
<li>Test subject expresses frustration (comment, sigh, grumble),</li>
<li>Subject takes a different route to achieve a goal than expected,</li>
<li>User fails to carry out a task.</li>
</ul>
